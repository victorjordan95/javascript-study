THE 'THIS' VARIABLE

- Regular function call : the 'this' keyword points at the global object (the window object, in the browser);

- Method call : the 'this' variable points to the object that is calling the method;

OBS: The this keyword is not assigned a value until a function where it is defined is a actually called;
