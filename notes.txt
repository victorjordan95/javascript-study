Notes from lectures

----- THE 'THIS' VARIABLE ----- 

- Regular function call : the 'this' keyword points at the global object (the window object, in the browser);

- Method call : the 'this' variable points to the object that is calling the method;

OBS: The this keyword is not assigned a value until a function where it is defined is a actually called;

----- EVENTS ----- 

Events: Notifications that are sent to notify the code that something happened on the webpage;

    Ex: Clicking a button, resizing a window, scrolling down or pressing a key;

Event Listener: A function that performs an action based on a certain event. It waits for a specific event to happen;

----- OBJECTS IN JS -----

Javascript is a prototype-based language, which means that inheritance works by using something called prototype.

    - Every Javascript object has a prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in Javascript;

    - The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit;

    - The constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the constructor itself, it's the prototype of ALL instances that are 
    created through it;

    - When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on to the 
    object's prototype. This continues until the method is found: prototype chain.

----- FUNCTIONS -----

    - A function is an instance of the Object type;

    - A function behaves like any other object;

    - We can store functions in a variable;

    - We can pass a function as an argument to another function;

    - We can return a function from a function;

And is we say JS is first-class
